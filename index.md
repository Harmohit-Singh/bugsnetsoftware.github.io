# BUGSnet R package

## Preamble

The number of publications using network meta-analysis (NMA) has increased dramatically within the past decade. Despite this increase, several reviews have noted shortcomings with respect to the quality of the conduct and reporting of NMAs. Network meta-analyses should be conducted and reported according to published best practices guidelines, namely the [PRISMA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26030634), [ISPOR-AMPC-NCA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636374) and [NICE-DSU](http://nicedsu.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TSD7-reviewer-checklist.final_.08.05.12.pdf) guidelines. These guidelines request numerous outputs that a single package does not currently provide. Moreover results (especially plots) are not publication-ready and often considerable time and effort must be spent to get them into a presentable state. 

BUGSnet is a new feature-rich R package to conduct high-quality Bayesian NMA analyses and facilitate compliance with best practice guidelines and reporting. Bayesian analyses are conducted with [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/) (BUGS code is automatically generated by the package based on the user's inputs.) Outputs are highly customizable and include [network plots](images/network.png), tables of network characteristics, [data plots](images/covariate.png), league tables and [league heat plots](images/league.png), [SUCRA plots](images/SUCRA.png), rankograms, forest plots, [leverage plots](images/fit.png), traceplots and posterior mean deviance comparison plots.

We hope that this software will help improve the conduct and reporting of NMAs.
